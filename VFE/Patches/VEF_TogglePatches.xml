          <description>The CZ 581 is a trusty old shotgun still found in many parts of Eastern Europe. It is a low-tech yet powerful weapon typically used by hunters. Unlike some other double-barreled shotguns, the Kozlice employs an over/under design, placing the two 12 gauge barrels in vertical alignment. These can either be loaded with slug or buckshot shells. Certain criminal elements have been known to improvise sawed-off versions of the shotgun. These are easier to conceal and operate in confined spaces, but also have a reduced effective range.</description>
